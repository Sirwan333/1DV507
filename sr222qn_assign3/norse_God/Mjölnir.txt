In Norse mythology, Mjölnir (/'mj??ln??r/;[1] Old Norse: Mjollnir, IPA: ['mj?l?nir])[2] is the hammer of Thor, the Norse god associated with thunder. Mjölnir is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the most fearsome and powerful weapons in existence, capable of leveling mountains.[3][4][5] In its account of Norse mythology, the Prose Edda relates how the hammer's characteristically short handle was due to a mistake during its manufacture. Similar hammers (Ukonvasara) were a common symbol of the god of thunder in other North European mythologies.

Modern depictions of Mjolnir are prevalent amongst practitioners of Heathenry (a modern Pagan religious movement) and white supremacist groups.
